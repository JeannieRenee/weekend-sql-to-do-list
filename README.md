# SQL TO-DO

## Description

_Duration: 6 hours_

This was one of the first applications I made, 9 weeks into learning how to code and three days of learning SQL.

I was asked to create an application that allows a user to create a task, add it to a list, update task status to finished and delete tasks. 

Once user input is submitted using a submit button, the app collects the information and stores it to a database. Information is then refreshed and the added task is displayed on the webpage.

Keep in mind, the app does take around 30 seconds to load.
